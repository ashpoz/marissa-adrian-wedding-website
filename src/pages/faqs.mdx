## Is there parking at the reception?

There is paid parking along the street and in nearby parking garages. It’s recommended that you take a car service such as Uber if possible or carpool.

---

## Is there a dress code?

The dress code is cocktail attire, though we encourage you to wear whatever you feel most comfortable and beautiful in.

## Can I bring a date to the reception?

While we’d of course love for everyone to bring a date to the reception, there just isn’t enough space. Invited guests will be clearly specified on the RSVP form.
You are welcome to bring +1s to the Sunday Lunch event the following day!

## Can I bring my children to the reception?

We love your kids, but because of the venue type, location, and capacity restraints, we have chosen to have a childfree reception. Invited guests will be clearly specified on the RSVP form. Parents are welcome to bring their children to the Sunday Lunch event the following day!
