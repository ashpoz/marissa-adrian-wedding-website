## Is there parking at the reception?

There is paid parking along the street and in nearby parking garages. It’s
recommended that you take a car service such as Uber if possible or carpool.

---

## Is there a dress code?

The dress code is cocktail attire, though we encourage you to wear whatever you feel most comfortable and beautiful in.

---

## Can I bring a date to the reception?

While we’d of course love for everyone to bring a date to the reception, there just isn’t enough space. Invited guests will be clearly specified on the RSVP form. You are welcome to bring +1s to Cosmic Coffee on Sunday if you plan to come to our farewell lunch!

## Can I bring my children to the reception?

We love your kids, but because of the venue type, location, and capacity restraints, we have chosen to have a childfree reception. Invited guests will be clearly specified on the RSVP form. You are welcome to bring your children to Cosmic Coffee on Sunday if you plan to come to our farewell lunch!
