## Airbnb, Vrbo, etc

There are many vacation rental options in Austin! Anywhere you stay will be fun, and you can get an Uber to the reception venue from anywhere in the city. That said, here are our neighborhood suggestions if you plan to go this route:

### Downtown

Downtown is where you’ll find everything from the Texas State Capitol, to live music venues, to some of the best restaurants and bars in the city.

### South Congress / South Lamar / South First

These neighborhoods are very walkable to many restaurants and shops. South of the river (and downtown), but still very close to the venue.

### Zilker & Barton Hills

If you want to stay somewhere closer to nature but still be in the city, this is the spot for you. These neighborhoods are next to Zilker Park, Barton Springs (open all year!), and the Greenbelt.

### Clarksville & Tarrytown

Two of the oldest and most historic neighborhoods in Austin. Close enough to downtown that you can see the skyline in the distance, but it feels much quieter and more residential.
